# crap-rpg

A repo for students of frontend to practise their basic HTML, CSS and JS skills.

The assignment is to fork & clone the repo and open it on your local browser. Check out the game. Play it to understand the underlying code. Read the code and get to know it. Finally improve the code! And maybe add new features.

# ⚠️ BAD CODE ⚠️

Warning!!! The code is intentionally badly written. Hence the name crap-rpg. There should be lots of obvious things to improve on. Also some more subtle. Also some bugs. That is the purpose of the repo and the aim of the excersise.

# Suggested issues to fix

There are a lot of big and small things that are bad in the code. Find the ones you find. If you are very new to coding then here are some hints what to look for:

-  Look at spacing between components in the UI and make sure things are not too tight but spaced cleanly & evenly

-  North, South, East and West buttons could fill the width of the screen each being the same width

-  Remove "magic numbers" in the code

-  Make sure names of variables and functions are consistent and correct

-  Make sure that names of variables and functions reflect their purpose

-  Make the code DRY

-  Make sure the HTML is correct

# Suggested new features

-  Add health points so you don't die immediately at a monster encounter. Maybe loose some HP and flee to an adjacent position.

-  Add level up when you slay a monster

-  Add some win condition so the game ends in Victory!
