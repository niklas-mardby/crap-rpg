# crap-rpg

A repo for students of frontend to practise their basic HTML, CSS and JS skills.

The assignment is to clone the repo and open it on your local browser. Check out the game. Then read the code and get to know it. Finally improve the code! And add new features.

# ⚠️ BAD CODE ⚠️

Warning! The code is intentionally badly written. Hence the name crap-rpg. There should be lots of obvious things to improve on. Also some more subtle. That is the purpose of the repo and the aim of the excersise.

# Suggested issues to fix

There are a lot of big and small things that are bad in the code. Find the ones you find and work at improving. If you are very new to coding then here are some hints what to look at:

-  Look at spacing between components and make sure things are not too tight but spaced cleanly & evenly

-  North, South, East and West buttons could fill the width of the screen each being the same width

-  Remove magic numbers

-  Make sure names of variables are consistent
