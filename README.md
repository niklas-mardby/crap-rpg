# crap-rpg

A repo for students of frontend to practise their basic HTML, CSS and JS skills.

The assignment is to clone the repo and open it on your local browser. Check out the game. Then read the code and get to know it. Finally improve the code! And add new features.

The code is intentionally writte bad. Hence the name crap-rpg. There should be lots of obvious things to improve on. Also some more subtle.
